GRUB2 (the GRand Unified Bootloader)

GNU GRUB is a multiboot boot loader.

If you want to set the size of gfxterm font,
then specify FONT_SIZE=size in the build options.
The default size is 14.

If you want to install grub2 on GPT,
you need to put a BIOS boot partition on GPT.

To correctly detect kernel and initrd images, their names need to conform to
the specific format:
kernel: vmlinuz-<version>
initrd: initrd.img-<version>
<version> can have strings other than version numbers, e.g. generic-2.6.37.6.
You can look into /etc/grub.d/10_linux for details.

Some instructions you need to install grub:
grub-install <device>
grub-mkconfig -o <config_path>

This requires os-prober, gnu-unifont, and help2man.
