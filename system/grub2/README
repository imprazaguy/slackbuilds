GRUB2 (the GRand Unified Bootloader) is a multiboot boot loader.

If you want to set the size of gfxterm font, then specify 
FONT_SIZE=size in the build options.  The default size is 16.

If you want to install grub2 on GPT, you need to put a BIOS boot 
partition on GPT.  To install it in the MBR replacing lilo, launch grub-install
and generate a config file in /boot/grub, e.g.

grub-install /dev/sda
grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg

To correctly detect kernel and initrd images, their names need to conform to
the specific format:
kernel: vmlinuz-<version>
initrd: initrd.img-<version>
<version> can have strings other than version numbers, e.g. generic-3.2.29.
You can look into /etc/grub.d/10_linux for details.
